## Building
### Requirements
Initially project have been build with these versions
1. cargo 1.70.0
2. rustc 1.70.0
3. wasm-bindgen 0.2.86 (required only for web build)

### Windows build
There is two main building options first one is building `exe` file, and second one is a `web` version.
As for `exe` version, you simply can do default or use preexisting `build.bat` and `make.bat` script.
```bash
cargo build --release 
```
Cargo will automatically, download and build dependencies, such as bevy.

### Web build
As for the web version, you will need to have `wasm-bindgen` cli utility(see this guide [link](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/reference/cli.html)). After installing `wasm-bindgen`, you can try to run 
```bash
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```
this command will compile game into a wasm file. Then you can follow this guide [link](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/platforms/wasm.html). For development simplicity there is also `web-build` script, that compiles game into a wasm file, and runs `wasm-bindgen` automatically.
